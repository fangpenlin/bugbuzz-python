# Bugbuzz - easy to use online debugger

![Bugbuzz demo](/screencast.gif?raw=true )

# Dashboard shortcuts

Vim style shortcuts

 - C Continue
 - H Return
 - J Next
 - L Step


# Usage:

This is still a prototype stage service, you clone it

```
git clone git@github.com:victorlin/bugbuzz-python.git
```

run

```
virtualenv --no-site-packages .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

then

```
python demo.py
```

It will open a new tab in your browser for debugging.

# Notice

 - This is just a prototype, use it at your own risk
 - The source code and local variables you are debugging (encountered breakpoints or pause) will be uploaded to the server, but they will be encrypted, then decrypted on the dashboard, we cannot know the content as we don't have the access key generated by this library.
